Overview
This repository contains a microservices-based application designed to demonstrate the principles of microservices architecture. The application is built using modern technologies and best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

Features
Modular Design: Each microservice is a standalone application with its own database and business logic.
API Gateway: A central entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.
Service Discovery: Automatic discovery of services using a service registry (e.g., Eureka, Consul).
Load Balancing: Efficient distribution of incoming traffic across multiple instances of a microservice.
Resilience Patterns: Implementation of patterns like Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Fallback to handle failures gracefully.
Configuration Management: Centralized configuration management using tools like Spring Cloud Config or Consul.
Event-Driven Communication: Asynchronous communication between microservices using message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
Monitoring and Logging: Integrated monitoring and logging solutions to track the health and performance of microservices.
